I came to Yujen often for code reviews and he was always happy to go over my work, process the logic, and make any suggestions. A couple of helpful things that Yujen introduced to me during our time working together is using conditional rendering in React components and using object-oriented design in backend development. I felt like I learned something new every time I come across the code he's written. I’m thankful that Yujen was a senior developer on our team as he has contributed to my coding knowledge greatly.",
